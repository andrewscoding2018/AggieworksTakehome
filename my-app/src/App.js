            <p>I'm fairly new to web development - so you have to click the Set Stock Ticker button twice. <br></br>(I know this is an issue with useEffect - which I'm learning right now.)
              <br></br>Anyhow, I hope you liked my choice of background image ðŸ˜‰.
              <br></br>The plotly package I used has a lot of tools - try clicking and dragging on the graph. 
              <br></br>Also, the background has *parallax* effect. </p>
